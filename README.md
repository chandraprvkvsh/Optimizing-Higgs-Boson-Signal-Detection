# The-Higgs-Boson-Challenge
The famous Higgs Boson Challenge

The Higgs Boson particle was discovered in 2013. A key property of any particle is how often it decays into other particles. ATLAS is a particle physics experiment taking place at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN that searches for new particles and processes using head-on collisions of protons of extraordinarily high energy. The ATLAS experiment has recently observed a signal of the Higgs boson decaying into two tau particles, but this decay is a small signal buried in background noise. 

The goal of the project is to improve the procedure that produces the selection region. We provide a training set with signal/background labels and with weights, a test set (without labels and weights), and a formal objective representing an approximation of the median significance (AMS) of the counting test. 

The objective is a function of the weights of selected events. It is expected that significant improvements are possible by revisiting some of the ad hoc choices in the standard procedure, or by incorporating the objective function or a surrogate into the classifier design.
