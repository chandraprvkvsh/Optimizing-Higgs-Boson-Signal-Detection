# The-Higgs-Boson-Challenge

## Overview
The Higgs Boson Challenge revolves around enhancing the selection procedure for identifying the decay of the Higgs boson particle into two tau particles. This project is based on data from the ATLAS experiment at CERN, which explores new particles and processes through high-energy proton collisions.

The discovery of the Higgs Boson in 2013 marked a significant breakthrough in particle physics. However, accurately detecting its decay amidst background noise remains a formidable challenge. 

The project aims to refine the selection process by improving existing methodologies or introducing novel approaches. A training set containing signal/background labels and weights, along with a test set devoid of labels and weights, is provided. The evaluation metric for this challenge is based on the approximation of the median significance (AMS) of the counting test. The objective function is a function of the weights of selected events.

## Data
The dataset for this project can be accessed on Kaggle at [Higgs Boson Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson/overview). For detailed information about the dataset, refer to the [documentation](https://higgsml.lal.in2p3.fr/files/2014/04/documentation_v1.8.pdf).
